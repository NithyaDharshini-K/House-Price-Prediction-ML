## 🚀 **About the Project**  
House price prediction is an essential application of **Machine Learning** in real estate, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.  

This project applies **XGBoost Regressor**, a powerful and efficient machine learning algorithm, to predict house prices based on various real estate attributes.  

---

## 📂 **Dataset**  
The dataset used is **House Price India.csv**, which contains multiple features related to house pricing, such as:  

- **Location**  
- **Square Foot Area**  
- **Number of Bedrooms & Bathrooms**  
- **Amenities & Facilities**  
- **Price (Target Variable)**
